Forex Gaps

In this post I want to cover Forex gaps that happened this Monday during Asian market hours.

Forex gaps are sharp breaks in exchange rate.It indicates that no trader is willing to trade at the given exchnage rate.

Gaps usually occur when market opens after the weekend(or holiday) and there were some news that affected the exchnage rates.

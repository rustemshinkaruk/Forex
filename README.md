Forex Gaps

In this post I want to cover Forex gaps that happened this Monday during Asian market hours.

Forex gaps are sharp breaks in exchange rate. They indicate that no trader is willing to trade at the given exchange rate.

Gaps usually occur when market opens after the weekend (or holiday) and there were some news that affected the exchange rates

If the exchange rate gaps up (down) then no trader was willing to sell (buy) within the gap. 

Gaps bring about the risk of getting past of your stop order (or limit order) and being filled at a worse exchange rate. This is called Slippage - when your expected and realized execution exchange rates are different. 

After the gap, exchange rates can result in the corrective action. The exchange rate can reverse after the gap to fill it. On the graphs we can see that after the gap, the exchange rates climbed back up.

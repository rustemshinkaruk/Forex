# Forex Triangles

I was monitoring Forex markets and encountered a pattern, from the technical analysis, that has formed on the pair EURUSD.

There are three main types of Forex triangles: Ascending (Bullish), Descending (Bearish) and Symmetrical triangles. On the graph below we observe a triangle that lies somewhere between Symmetrical and Bearish triangle.

The idea of the triangle pattern is that when we reach the pinnacle of the triangle, technical traders expect the price to go either up or down by the magnitude of a triangle base (largest vertical line that you can fit inside the triangle).

The beauty of the technical trading is that there is no fundamental rationale behind the pattern but since all investors are aware of the pattern they will still invest and the price will be pushed toward the predicted pattern.

Most likely the exchange rate will go down as the triangle resembles more the Bearish type and the exchange rate already started its path down.
